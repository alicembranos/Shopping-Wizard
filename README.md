### The repo

You only need to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/assembler-school/js-shopping-wizard.git
```

### Dependencies

This project is created with Vanilla JS so you don't need to import any dependency.

## 1. Introduction

In this project you must develop a shopping process form with steps, where each step will have its own validation.

### What are the main objectives in this project?

- Improve your knowledge of <b>JavaScript</b>
- Learn to work with the <b>HTML DOM.</b>
- Learn and improve your knowledge in logic processes
- Learn to <b>validate forms</b> using <b>Javascript</b>.

## 2. General analysis

The form will contain several steps that will need to be hidden and show others in order to move along the steps.This means there will be just one HTML page and the content will be changed dynamically.

## 3. Develop a form

The objective of this pill is to develop an <b>HTML form</b> with <b>custom CSS</b> styles and <b>JS validation. After each phase (screen) change your team roles</b> and work on the part your team member was previously coding, this way all of you can have a general understing for each phase. To develop the form you must take into account the following fields and their own validations:

- <b>Phase 1: Product</b>

## 3.1 Form requirements

Below are the general requirements that the form should have:

- Each step page will contain a ‚Äúnext‚Äù and a ‚Äúclear form‚Äù button.
  - The ‚Äúnext‚Äù button will link to the next step.
  - The information of the form will be saved in memory, the main purpose of this pill is to learn to work with HTML, CSS and JS together with the part of validation done in Javascript.
  - The ‚Äúreset‚Äù button will reset all the input values in the current step introduced by the user to the default ones.
  - Step 4 will contain a ‚Äúfinish‚Äù button instead ‚Äúnext‚Äù that will link to the ‚Äúthank you‚Äù page.
  - In this page there will be a link to start the form again.
- All the JS validation messages will be displayed in the screen below the respective input in a paragraph with the custom message.
  - This element must be loaded in the HTML using Javascript.
  - You will need to apply custom styles to the inputs that have not passed the validation to apply some error. styling, such as the letter or container being shown in red
- For every minute that the user remains in the purchase process (step 1, step2, step 3 and step 4), a message must be shown on the screen that must be hidden 5 seconds after it appears.
- The purchase process will have a time limit of 5 minutes (start in step 1), if it is not completed in this period of time (the process is completed by reaching the thank you page), a message should appear on the screen indicating that the maximum time allowed for the purchase process has been exceeded and will automatically redirect you to the product screen in 5 seconds (the first screen)
- When you reach the Thank You page you will show all the values that are specified in the documentation (shipping, purchase time, ...) and then you will have to reset all the information that you have stored in this process (time, price, ‚Ä¶)

## 3.2 Wireframes

## 4. Requirements

- You will have to implement the entire application using a single HTML file
- All the processes must be carried out without reloading the page
- You cannot use cookies, localStorage or any similar technologies
- You cannot use third-party libraries

## 5.Extras üíØ

Once you have implemented the main features of the application you should implement the following extra requirements (that are not specified in any particular order) as a challenge for yourself and your team. However, you can also consider them during the development of the pill if you would like to implement any of them from the beginning, such as the design requirements or the browser compatibility.

<b>It is easier to develop a feature from the beginning than to modify it later.</b>

### 5.1 Browser compatibility

You should check that everything is compatible with other current browsers, and, as an extra step.

### 5.2 Input validation

All the input validation should be done after users have entered a value, this means that you should only validate the value in the input fields after a value has been entered and not before users interact with the inputs.

- The validation should be done when the input field loses focus, that is, users type a value, they change focus to another element, then the field validation runs.
- After a validation message is entered and users focus the input element to adjust the value, the validation message and any error styles should be removed until the user has entered a new value and the focus is lost from the input field as before.

### 5.3 Design

The design of the application should be different to the wireframe look we provide.

### 5.4 Remove event listeners

All the event listeners that were attached to the elements in the other containers such as modals should be removed to avoid memory leaks.

### 5.5 Responsive design

All the screens and steps should be responsive <b>using flexbox or grid</b> so that they can be used in any device size.

### 5.6 Accessibility

You should use semantic HTML elements for all the app such as buttons and HTML5 sectioning elements (main, section, nav, etc)

## 6. Deliverables

To evaluate the project you will need the following deliverables:

- Project repository with:
  - A presentation in Google Slides explaining:
  - Explain what lessons you‚Äôve learned during this project
  - What problems have you encountered when developing this project?
  - Explain how you changed roles to develop the project for each phase (screen)
